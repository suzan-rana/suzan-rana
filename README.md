I want to a software developer and I plan to learn backend development with NestJS, learn about deploying apps in aws and also learn flutter to build mobile apps. I want to learn alot of things, but I have my exams in about 20days and there is the good DSA that I know nothing about, thus I am sad and the worst part is I have to learn it using C language which I donot want to go indepth into. 

---------------Currently doing NextJS at LMU (iloveLMU)-----------------------------------
